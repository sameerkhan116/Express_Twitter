# Express Twitter

An application for realtime tweeting using Express with Handlebars view engine.
Using passport for authentication with local strategy.
Also using socket.io for communicating with twitter for realtime updates.

To run clone the contents of this repository and in the terminal run:

yarn start runs nodemon with babel-node so we can write all our code in ES6+.

This will run a nodemon instance of the server.
